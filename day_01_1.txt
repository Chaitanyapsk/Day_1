statical typed languag

1)In this type of variable is known at compile time.
2)Every variable known befere compiling process
3)in this once a variable is assigned a type it canâ€™t be assigned to some other variable of a different type
4)Declared variable & Data type is fixed

Dynamically_typed language

1)In this variable check during Run-time.
2)No need to specify the data type of each variable .
3)In this we need not worry about the types of variable
4)dynamically-typed languages are comparatively faster during development time and are more flexible.

iii)These are well suited for large projects
iv)These are used to transform set of data

Scripting Language

i)It is a type of programming language which does not require explicit compilation step and it is designed for a runtime system to automate the execution of tasks
ii)It is an easy and quick process to learn coding in Scripting language
iii)There are less number of data structures and variable to be used, which make it highly efficient
iv)These are Less code-intensive as compared to traditional programming languages
